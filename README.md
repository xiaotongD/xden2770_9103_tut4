Week 8 Quiz

Part 1

The imaging technique that I find inspiring for my assignment is from the movie "Nun II." There's a scene that I find very creative: the magazines in the magazine stand turn over by themselves, and eventually, they stop on certain pages, where the pictures on those pages and form the shape of a nun. I want to use the technique of assembling large patterns from small images in my project. It can not only flip itself but also allow users to manipulate small images to create different faces, it must be a fun thing to do.

Part 2

I think the image processing coding technique could assist in implementing the image technique. To achieve the result, I will first collect many images of different faces at the same angle and position, then I will use the image() function to get different parts of different images, and then put the pieces together into a complete image. To animate every parts of the face, I'm going to use the transform technique to achieve the turning effect. Here is the video of the coding tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZOrpJ-GNiY&t=1639s (the code is just showed in the video)

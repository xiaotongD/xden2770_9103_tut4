Week 8 Quiz

Part 1
The imaging technique that I find inspiring for my assignment is from the movie "Nun II." There's a scene that I find very creative: the magazines in the magazine stand turn over by themselves, and eventually, they stop on certain pages, where the pictures on those pages form the shape of a nun. I want to use the technique of assembling large patterns from small images in my project. It can not only flip itself but also allow users to manipulate small images to create different faces, it must be a fun thing to do.
